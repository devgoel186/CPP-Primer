# CPP-Primer

Thorough/in-depth understanding of the CPP Primer book by Stanley B. Lippman and stuff from [here](https://www.learncpp.com/)

## C++ compilation steps

- Compilation into machine language file called the object file.
- Linking of object files and libraries, which is done by the linker.

## Errors and Warnings

- `-Werror` to convert warnings to errors.
- `-Wall` to enable all type of warning triggers.
- `-Wextra` enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by `-Wall`.
- `-Wsign-conversion` warns for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an integer value, like assigning a signed integer expression to an unsigned integer variable.
